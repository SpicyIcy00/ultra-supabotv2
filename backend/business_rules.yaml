# Performance tips for Claude
query_tips:
  - "Always filter by transaction_time early in WHERE clause - it's indexed"
  - "Use store_id index when filtering by specific stores"
  - "Use product_id index when filtering by specific products"
  - "Avoid SELECT * - specify needed columns"
  - "Use table aliases: t=transactions, ti=transaction_items, p=products, s=stores, i=inventory"
